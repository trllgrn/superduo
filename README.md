# SuperDuo
Udacity Android Nanodegree P3

In the SuperDuo project, student's are asked to take two already working apps and address some issues from "feedback"

The two projects in this repo are:
* Alexandria - a book collection management app
My claim to fame on this app was adding the zxing barcode scanning library.  It adds amazing functionality!

* Football Scores - just what it sounds like, an app that tracks football/soccer scores for various international leagues
This app marks my firts foray into widgets.  I also feel like this is where I mastered Content Providers.
 
In order to run the apps, you'll need to clone the repo and have Android Studio installed.
Build and run the apps using Studio just as you would from scratch apps.
You'll need an emulator or physical Android device.

I will be adding pictures and perhaps video very soon.
