# SuperDuo
Udacity Android Nanodegree P3

In the SuperDuo project, student's are asked to take two already working apps and address some issues from "feedback"

The two projects in this repo are:
1. Alexandria - a book collection management app

2. Football Scores - just what it sounds like, an app that tracks football/soccer scores for various international leagues
